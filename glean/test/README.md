# Roadmap

* `regression`: framework for testing indexers and code that depends on
  being able to perform Glean queries on indexed source code.

* `tests`: tests for Glean itself

* `lib`: library code used in `tests` and elsewhere

* `unit`: library code for building unit tests

* `tailer`: tests for streaming writes
