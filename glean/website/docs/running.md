## Configuration files

Glean tools use some configuration files. Mostly these are optional,
if you don't provide the file then a set of defaults will be assumed.

Config files are represented as JSON-encoded Thrift values. Each
configuration file has a corresponding Thrift definition file, which
we'll link to in the docs below.

The location of a config file is specified by a command line
option, e.g. Glean clients have a `--client-config` option:

```
--client-config (file:PATH | config:PATH)
```

the alternatives are:

* Omit the flag: default values will be used.
* `--client-config file:PATH` means the config is read, once, from `PATH`.

<FbInternalOnly>

* `--client-config config:PATH` means the config is read from `PATH`
  in configerator.

</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>

* `--client-config config:PATH` means the config is read from `DIR/PATH`
  where `DIR` defaults to `$HOME/.config/glean` but can be changed with the `--config-dir DIR` flag. Additionally, changes in the file are picked up without restarting the tool. (this is particularly useful for the server)

The idea is that if you're running a fleet of Glean servers, you can
have a set of configuration files that you sync to all the hosts in
your fleet using whatever mechanism you want, and set `--config-dir`
to point to the location of the files.  If this isn't sufficient, then
you can implement your own `ConfigProvider` instance to support
whatever method you need for accessing config files.

## Common options

All the Glean tools (`glean`, `glean-server`) accept
the following options.

<OssOnly>

* `--config-dir DIR`<br />
The base directory where [configuration files](#configuration-files) are read from.

</OssOnly>

### Connecting to a remote server

<FbInternalOnly>

* `--service TIER or HOST:PORT`<br />
**Default:** taken from `--client-config`<br />
Specifies the Glean server to connect to.  `TIER` is
implementation-dependent (not supported in the open-source build
currently).

</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>

* `--service HOST:PORT`<br />
**Default:** taken from `--client-config`<br />
Specifies the Glean server to connect to.

</OssOnly>

* `--client-config (file:PATH | config:PATH)`<br />
**Default:**<Alt internal="config:glean/client/client" external="config:client" /> or use default values if missing<br />
**Thrift file:** [client-config.thrift](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean/blob/master/glean/config/client/client_config.thrift)<br />
The location of the client configuration file, which specifies the
default Glean server to connect to, amongst other things.

<FbInternalOnly>

* `--use-shards yes|no|fallback`<br />
FB-only: whether to use shards when connecting to a host in the tier.

</FbInternalOnly>

### Using local databases

* `--db-root DIR | --db-tmp | --db-memory`<br />
**Default**: `--db-tmp`<br />
Where Glean databases are stored. When `--db-tmp` is used, Glean
creates a temporary directory for storage, and deletes it on
exit. `--db-memory` stores databases in memory.

* `--schema (file:FILE | dir:DIR | config:PATH | DIR)`<br />
**Default**: <Alt internal="indexconfig:glean/schema/index" external="dir:$datadir/glean/schema/source" /><br />
The location of the schema definition. This can either be:
  * `dir:DIR` or just `DIR`<br />
    All the files with the extension `.angle` under `DIR` (or in
    subdirectories) will be read.
  * `file:FILE` or `config:PATH`<br/>
    A single file, which can be created from the source files in `DIR` by running `gen-schema --dir DIR --source FILE`<br />
    If you are running a fleet of Glean servers, you would normally
    sync schema changes across the fleet by putting the schema
    in `config:schema`.
  * `index:FILE` or `indexconfig:PATH`<br/> A *schema index*, which
    contains multiple versions of the schema. When using a schema
    index, the server uses the version of the schema requested by the
    client. A schema index can be produced by `gen-schema
    --update-index`. The purpose of a schema index is so that in a
    production environment, when you deploy a new version of the
    schema, existing deployed clients and indexing jobs can continue
    to use the version of the schema they were compiled against.

<FbInternalOnly>

* `--recipe-config (file:PATH | config:PATH)`<br />
**Default:** <Alt internal="config:glean/recipes/recipes" external="config:recipes" /> or use default values if missing<br />
**Thrift file:** [recipe-config.thrift](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean/blob/master/glean/config/recipes/recipes.thrift)<br />
The location of the recipes config file. This is used by certain
indexers to specify the indexing steps and dependencies between them.

</FbInternalOnly>

* `--server-config (file:PATH | config:PATH)`<br />
**Default**: <Alt internal="config:glean/server" external="config:server" /><br />
**Thrift file:** [server-config.thrift](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean/blob/master/glean/config/server/server_config.thrift)

* `--tier TIER`<br />
Equivalent to <Alt internal="--server-config config:glean/server/TIER" external="--server-config config:server/TIER" /><br />
Can be handy when you have fleet-wide configuration files but you
want certain servers to have different configs.

* `--db-read-only`<br />
Disable writing to databases. This is useful if you have servers that only
serve queries, and should not be creating or writing databases.

<FbInternalOnly>

* `--enable-logging`<br />
Enable logging of all operations to Scuba.

</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>

* `--enable-logging`<br />
Enable logging of all operations. (Note that there is currently no
logging backend implemented for the open-source build of Glean, so
this doesn't do anything yet).

</OssOnly>

### Testing options

* `--db-mock-writes`<br />
Allow write operations, but discard the data and don't write it to the DB.

* `--debug-tc`<br />
Enable debugging output for the Angle typechecker.

* `--debug-query`<br />
Enable debugging output for the Angle query compiler.
