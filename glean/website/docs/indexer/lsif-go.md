To index [Go](https://go.dev/) we use SourceGraph's [LSIF indexer for Go](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go). [LSIF](https://lsif.dev) is a new format for tools to share information about code. Binary releases of [lsif-go](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go/releases) are available ffor x86 Linux which will work as Glean indexers. The LSIF indexer uses a recent (>1.15) [version of Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

## Run the indexer

The indexer is run via the main `glean` CLI tool.

```
> cabal build exe:glean
```

And index your Go repository with:
```
glean index go DIR --repo name/hash
```

where

* `DIR` is the root directory containing the Go project
* `name/hash` is the name of the repository to create

Provide the usual `--db-root` and `--schema` or `--service` arguments
to `glean`

## In the shell

Go source can also be indexed directly from the Glean shell:

```
:index go DIR
```

The shell will pick a DB name and hash for you based on `DIR`.

## Schema

The schema is in <SrcFile file="glean/schema/source/lsif.angle" />
