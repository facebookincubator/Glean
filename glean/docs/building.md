## Introduction

Glean is written mainly in [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/), and
makes heavy use of
[Thrift](https://github.com/facebookincubator/hsthrift) for data
communication and serialization, so these are the main dependencies
that are needed for building Glean.

## You will need

* Linux. The build is only tested on Linux so far; we hope to add
  support for other OSs in the future.

* [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/). To see which versions Glean is tested with, check the current [ci.yml](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml) script.

* Cabal/cabal-install. Unfortunately because hsthrift currently depends on features that are not in a released version of Cabal (3.6+), you have to build it from source, see https://github.com/facebookincubator/hsthrift#building-and-testing

Additional per-distribution setup follows.

### Ubuntu

Install prerequisite packages. (many of these are dependencies of
hsthrift; an up to date list can be found in the
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/facebookincubator/hsthrift/blob/master/.github/workflows/Dockerfile)
that we use for building the base image for CI).

```
sudo apt-get install \
    g++ \
    cmake \
    bison flex \
    git cmake \
    libzstd-dev \
    libboost-all-dev \
    libevent-dev \
    libdouble-conversion-dev \
    libgoogle-glog-dev \
    libgflags-dev \
    libiberty-dev \
    liblz4-dev \
    liblzma-dev \
    libsnappy-dev \
    make \
    zlib1g-dev \
    binutils-dev \
    libjemalloc-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    pkg-config \
    libunwind-dev \
    libsodium-dev \
    curl \
    libpcre3-dev \
    libmysqlclient-dev \
    libfftw3-dev \
    librocksdb-dev \
    libxxhash-dev
```

### Fedora

Install prerequisite packages:

```
sudo dnf install \
    g++ \
    make \
    cmake \
    binutils \
    bison flex \
    curl \
    libzstd-devel \
    boost-devel \
    libevent-devel \
    double-conversion-devel \
    glog-devel \
    gflags-devel \
    zlib-devel \
    openssl-devel \
    libunwind-devel \
    libsodium-devel \
    pcre-devel \
    community-mysql-devel \
    fftw-devel \
    rocksdb-devel \
    xxhash-devel
```

## Building

:::warning

The build process currently installs dependencies in
`/usr/local/lib`. This isn't ideal; we're working on a more
self-contained build process but it's not ready yet.

:::

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean.git
cd glean
```

These are necessary so that the Glean build can find the dependencies
that get installed in `/usr/local/lib`:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
```

Clone [hsthrift](https://github.com/facebookincubator/hsthrift) and
install its dependencies:

```
./install_deps.sh
```

Build everything:

```
make
```

If everything worked, the tests should pass:

```
make test
```

At this point you can `cabal install` to install the executables into
`~/.cabal/bin`.
