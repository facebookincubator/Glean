Derive Cxx.DeclFamily predicates from Cxx.Same predicates.

The indexer produces Cxx.Same predicates which indicates that two
declarations refer to the same underlying entity. Typically this
expresses the connection between a declaration and a definition,
but there may in general be many declarations for the same
definition, and even multiple definitions.

The Cxx.Same edges produced by the indexer are not transitively
closed.

In Diffusion and the dead-code analyses we want a global view of
the complete set of declarations for a given entity. This
derivation pass establishes that, by extracting the components of
the graph formed by the Cxx.Same edges.

The basic algorithm is:
* For each @Cxx.Same d1 d2@,
  * add @d1->d2@ to the graph
  * find the components of this graph (/O(n)/)
  * each component is a @Cxx.DeclFamily@
* For each @Cxx.DeclFamily@
  * Emit a @Cxx.DeclToFamily@ predicate for each decl in the family
