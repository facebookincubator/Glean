-- | Simple first-in, first-out cache holding a limited number of MonadIO
-- results.  This is ideal for repeated operations that expensive and
-- idempotent, such as queries.
--
-- When the number of items is more that the "high water mark" then
-- the older items are removed so that only "low water mark" remain.  The gap
-- between high and low values reduces the frequency of this garbage collection.
-- For example, I am aiming for a low water mark of half the high water mark.
--
-- Assumes 'withCacher' will not be called enough times to overflow
-- 'Word64' (within the high water mark).
--
-- Design of 'withCacher c f k' operation:
--
-- * If 'withCacher' find the value for 'k' the 'c_cache' then it returns
-- the cached value without blocking. Implemented here by reading
-- two 'IORefs'.
--
-- * If 'withCacher' does not find the value in the 'c_cache' then it
-- tries to run the operation 'f' on 'k' and add it to the cache
--
-- * When the operation 'f' is being run on 'k', additional requests for 'k'
-- should block instead of running 'f' on 'k' concurrently.
--
--     * This is \"should block\" instead of \"must block\" because
--     pending operations count against the high/low water mark
--
--     * If you have more pending keys than the low water mark then the cache
--     will lose track and the next 'withCacher' may run a new operation 'f'
--     on a 'k' that is already running concurrently
--
--     * Note that for 'q' not equal to 'k' the operation 'f' on 'q' will
--     happily run concurrently to 'f' on 'k', as you hopefully expected
--
-- * If 'withCacher' or the operation 'f' on 'k' fails to produce a value, e.g.
-- due to an exception, then
--
--     *  none of the properties or invariants break
--
--     * this exception bubbles up to the caller of 'withCacher' that was
--     running 'f'
--
--     * concurrent 'withCacher f k' that blocked will all wake up and try
--     again, and will they will not see the exception
--
--     * the next attempt will find no value and rerun operation 'f' on 'k'
--
-- Properties of c_write which holds pair '(lo, hi)' are:
--
--     * 'newCacher' starts at '(0,0)'
--
--     * has '(lo <= hi)' until 'hi' exceeds Work64 size (2^64 - 1). I think
--       rollover will not break Cacher.
--       In particular 0 <= (hi-lo) <= high water mark.
--
--     * the number of (possibly failed) items in c_cache is '(hi - lo)'
--
--     * 'withCacher' may increment 'hi' by one,
-- and may increment 'lo' to implement the high/low watermark policy
--
--     * 'clearCacher' will reset to '(0,0)'
--
-- Properties of c_cache, with values '(index, ciRef)' :
--
--     * Each index value in at most one value in the c_cache
--
--     * For c_write holding '(lo, hi)', we have 'lo < index <= hi'.
--
--     * The ciRef holding CacheItem b has a usual lifecycle of
--
--         * ciRef starts with CI_Pending v, with empty MVar v
--
--         * ciRef set to CI_Ready b, holding the cached result
--
--         * putMVar v () executes, unblocking any waiting readers
--
--     * The ciRef holding CacheItem b has a failure lifecycle of
--
--         * ciRef starts with CI_Pending v, with empty MVar v
--
--         * ciRef set to CI_Failed, when an exception has happened
--
--         * putMVar v () executes, unblocking any waiting readers (and one will
--             try the operation again)
--
--     * Note: Under high contention on a key, it is possible two 'tryRead' see
--       the cache is empty for a key and try to fill it with 'tryWrite'
--
--         * Both will allocate a new ciRef  but only one will put it in the
--           c_cache, the other ciRef will be discarded
--
--         * This race to fill the key is the source of 'R_LostRace'
--           and 'R_WonRace'
--
--         * The 'R_LostRace' path leads to calling 'tryRead' to wait in the
--           winner.
--
-- Other notes:
--
-- * Pending operations count against the high/low watermark, and might lead to
-- running 'f' on 'k' more than once concurrently.  If this is a problem then
-- you need a different data structure, not a cache.
--
-- * If the operation on 'k' fails then this still counts against the high/low
-- watermark.  Retrying on 'k' re-uses the same 'index', so will not
-- continue to use up the allowed number of items.  But a high failure rate
-- on many different values will leave less room in the cache for
-- successful results.
--
-- * I originally wrote 'checkLimits' so as not to slow down
-- the 'withCacher', by using forkIO to do the work in the background.  This
-- was overkill, since the 'withCacher' has already potentially blocked
-- on c_write.
--
-- * The current 'checkLimits' does any work of reducing the cache
-- to low water mark while blocking in 'withCacher', so the c_cache never
-- exceeds the high water mark.  If filtering the map becomes a latency issue
-- then we can resurrect my original code (from earlier version of D13215939)
-- or some other optimization.
