Reordering pass
---------------

INPUT

A FlattenedQuery, in which the statements are grouped:

  P where group; ...; group

a group is a set of statements that may be reordered:

  group ::= [ stmt, ..., stmt ]

and a stmt is

  stmt ::= P = generator
        |  !( group; ..; group )
        |  ( ( group; ..; group ) | ... | (group; ..; group) )

generator has the form
  - a term
  - a fact generator
  - an array generator
  - a call to a primitive

Patterns contain no nested generators at this point, everything has
been lifted to statements by the flattening pass.


OUTPUT

The same, except that the groups have been flattened and we just have
sequences of statements.

In addition, the output has valid binding. Namely:

  - MatchBind will occur before MatchVar for a given variable, where "before"
    means "left-to-right top-to-bottom".

  - There are no MatchBind or MatchWild in an expression context. These are:
    - patterns on the rhs of a statement
    - the head of the query
    - the array of an array generator
    - arguments to a primitive call


HOW?

Note first that the pass might FAIL if it can't find a way to express
the query such that it satisfies the above constraints.  For example,
there's no way to make

   _ = _

valid.  Similarly, there's no way to make

   X = Y

valid if neither X nor Y is bound by anything. However, if X or Y can
be bound by a later statement, then it might be possible to reorder
statements to make this valid.

In general, establishing correct binding could mean
  - re-ordering statements
  - flipping statements from P = Q to Q = P

Moreover, removing generators and or-patterns on the left will also
require some transformations.

For now, the pass does nothing clever: no reordering and limited
flipping. More cleverness will be added later.

{-
Note [Optimising statement groups]

A nested fact match in Angle compiles to a group of statements. For
example

   P { _, Q "abc" }

after flattening yields the group of statements

   P { _, X }
   X = Q "abc"

The purpose of reorderStmtGroup is to find a good ordering for the
statements in the group.

Things that we take into acccount are:
- A match with at most one result (point query) should probably be done early
- A match that never fails should probably be done late
- If a statement binds something that makes another statement more
  efficient, choose the ordering to exploit that

The algorithm is:

- construct a graph where the nodes are statements and
  - for each lookup statement (X = pred pat) (A)
  - for each statement that mentions X (B)
  - if pat is irrefutable
    - edge A -> B
  - if pat is a point match
    - edge B -> A
  - else, if X occurs in a prefix position in B
    - edge B -> A
  - else
    - edge A -> B
- render the postorder traversal of this graph

{-
After reordering groups, we perform some further obvious reorderings.

Note that here we're technically changing the order of statements that
the user wrote, so we better know what we're doing, because the user
has no control over this and we won't be able to manually fix the
Angle code to work around anything that the optimiser gets wrong.

So here we will:

1. Hoist a filter (P = Q) that is resolved (either P or Q is known)

This is important when we expand a derived predicate

    X = pred K

and the predicate is defined as 'Q where S', we typically generate

    X = Y where S; Y = K; Y = Q

(see Glean/Query/Expand.hs).

If unification doesn't deal with the X = K, Y = Q statements, then we
might need to hoist them ahead of S (or coversely, if we generated
them in the other order, on some occasions we might need to sink
them to avoid unresolved variables).

2. Sink a statement that is unresolved (P = Q where neither P nor Q is known)

This avoids "cannot resolve" errors that we can fix by reordering statements.
-}

{- Note [Reordering negations]

A negated subquery doesn't bind values to variables in its enclosing scope.

This means that if a variable is unbound in the evaluation of a negation it
will behave as a wildcard. This has implications for variables that will be
bound later as it means that the order of statements can change the meaning
of the query.

Consider the following query:

  K where !(Q A); P A;

As it stands it will be equivalent to

  K where !(Q _); P A;

Which will fail if there is any Q fact in the database.
If we invert the order of statements it will only fail if there were
specifically a `Q A` fact in the database.

  K where P A; !(Q A);

To ensure consistent semantics regardless of the order of statements in the
source query we always move negated subqueries after the binding of all
variables from the parent scope that it uses.

{- Note [local variables]

This is a legit query:

  X = "a" | (X where cxx.Name X)

This looks dodgy because X only appears in one branch on the rhs, but
in fact it's fine:
* (X where cxx.Name X) is reasonable
* "a" | (X where cxx.Name X) is reasonable, but doesn't bind X
* therefore in X = "a" | (X where cxx.Name X), the X on the left is binding.

You might think "let's reject it".  But even if the user didn't write
it like this, We might end up here after query optimisation, e.g. it
can start as

  X = "a" | (Z where cxx.Name Z)

and then unification will replace [X/Z]. Should we avoid doing that?
It seems hard to avoid while still doing all the useful optimisation
we want. e.g. in

  X = cxx.Name "foo"
  { X, Y } = { N, cxx.RecordDeclaraiton { name = N } } | ...

we'd really like N to unify with X.

So, let's just make it work.  If we do the naive thing and map X to a
variable _0, the codegen will see

  _0:string = "a" | (_0 where cxx.Name _0:string)

and it will generate bogus code, because the value we build in _0 on
the left depends on a value in _0 on the right.

To fix this we need to identify variables that are local to one side
of | and rename them so they can't clash with variables mentioned
elsewhere.  A "local" variable is one that isn't bound by both
branches of |.
