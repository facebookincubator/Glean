 * or missing during serialization. This is different from an unqualified
 * field, as an unqualified field is always serialized regardless of its value,

 * The annotation can be only used to annotate an unqualified field, and when
 * it is annotating a struct or exception, it changes all unqualified fields to
 * terse fields. Note, the annotation can not be used for union.
